## **MY PROJECTS**

### [Project 1: Guns.R](https://github.com/alliechs/alliechs.projects.github.io/tree/main/Guns%20R)

This is a small project I did in Rstudio using R to visualise Data. 
This includes coding and plotting:
- ANOVA (1 WAY & 2 WAY)
- Simple Regression
- Multiple Regression
- Decision Tree
- Chi-Square tests

Data was taken from a public dataset compiled by [Vincent Arel-bundock](https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html).
I chose a dataset called "Guns", which is a balanced panel of data on 50 US states by year for 1977â€“1999.
I was primarily interested in comparing violent crime rates against variables such as the incarceration rate and personal income.
My conclusion and comments can be found in the comments within the Guns.R file.
